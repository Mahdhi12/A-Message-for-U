<h1>4. Divided By Midnight</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="photo_2025-02-24_11-24-28.jpg" width="300px">
<p>Auda, a celestial protector and guardian of the universe’s equilibrium, falls in love with Anaam, a mortal. Their forbidden love angers powerful divine beings, who trap them in an eternal punishment—a red scarf binds their souls, and they vanish under the moonlight at 2 AM, severing their bond. Auda’s absence disrupts the universe’s balance, threatening its collapse. To restore equilibrium, the divine beings reincarnate Auda’s soul, splitting it into two incomplete halves, one merged with a girl named Clara and the other with a boy named Armaan. Unaware of their divine origins, Clara and Armaan grow up in different parts of the world, both feeling an inexplicable void in their lives. This emptiness manifests as vivid dreams where they meet an imaginary partner—an echo of their other half. Every night at 2 AM, they are drawn into a surreal dream-space lit by moonlight, where they share their thoughts and feelings without recognizing the true nature of their connection. In this dream world, they wear matching red scarves, a faint reminder of their intertwined destiny. Fate brings Clara and Armaan together in real life when Armaan moves to Korea for his studies and crosses paths with Clara, who works at her grandmother’s hotel. Although they initially feel no spark of recognition, small details from their shared dreams start surfacing in their real-world interactions—a red scarf glimpsed in the corner of their vision, familiar phrases, and an uncanny sense of knowing each other. As their bond deepens, the dreams intensify, and the truth begins to unravel. They discover that their souls are two halves of Auda, split to restore the universe’s balance. Their love is not just a personal connection but the key to healing the cosmos. The divine beings, fearing their reunion could destabilize the equilibrium again, attempt to intervene. In the climactic moment, Armaan visits Clara at 2 AM, wearing the red scarf from their dreams. Under the moonlight, the dream-space merges with reality, and they see each other’s true forms for the first time. Memories of their celestial past flood back, and their fractured souls begin to reunite, restoring their divine essence. But the universe’s balance is still fragile. Clara and Armaan must decide whether to fully merge and risk upsetting the equilibrium again or remain as two separate beings, carrying the burden of their incomplete selves. Their ultimate choice will determine the fate of their love—and the universe.</p>

<h1>7. A Vision Without Sleep</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="photo_2025-03-19_21-31-55.jpg" width="300px">
<p>A lonely young man lives in a world where his perfect partner exists—not in dreams, but in his waking imagination. To him, she is as real as the air he breathes, but to everyone else, she is just a fantasy. As his friends share their dreams of love, he begins to question why he has never seen her in his sleep—only in his mind.

    The deeper he falls into his illusion, the harder it becomes to distinguish reality from fiction. His mind warns him that if he realizes the truth too soon, the shock could shatter him completely. But when he meets a real girl who unknowingly mirrors the essence of his imaginary love, he is forced to confront the truth: is love only real if it exists outside his mind, or can imagination lead him to something even greater?
    
    Torn between the world he created and the one he never dared to embrace, he must make a choice—one that will define whether he remains trapped in a vision without sleep or wakes up to a love more beautiful than he ever imagined.</p>
